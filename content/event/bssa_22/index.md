summary: Fransiska is a guest editor of a special issue of the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America focused on seismoacoustics and seismoacoustic data fusion.  Submissions are due Nov 01, 2022.  
abstract: The Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America (BSSA) solicits manuscripts for a Special Section on Seismoacoustics and Seismoacoustic Data Fusion.
Natural (e.g., volcanic activity, earthquakes, mass movements, microbaroms, bolides) and anthropogenic phenomena (e.g., chemical explosions, mining blasts) can release energy as mechanical waves in the ground, ocean and atmosphere. Due to the mechanical coupling between a planet, the ocean and its atmosphere, waves can propagate across these interfaces and carry information about the source and the media they propagated through. A growing body of literature suggests that multi-technology geophysical observations provide unique constraints on the properties of both the sources and media. Leveraging multi-technology datasets is instrumental for the continued success of future planetary missions, nuclear test ban treaty verification and natural hazard monitoring. Progress in our theoretical understanding of mechanical coupling, advancements in coupled-media wave modeling and developments of efficient multi-technology inversion procedures are key to fully exploit geophysical datasets on Earth and beyond.
