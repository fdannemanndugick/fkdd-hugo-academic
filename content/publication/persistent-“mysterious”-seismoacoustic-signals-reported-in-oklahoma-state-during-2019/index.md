abstract: We report on the source of seismoacoustic pulses that were observed
  across the state of Oklahoma (OK) during summer of 2019, and the subject of
  national media coverage and speculation. Seismic network data collected across
  four U.S. states and interviews with witnesses to the pulse’s effect on
  residential structures demonstrate that they were triggered by routine
  ammunition disposal operations conducted by McAlester Army Ammunition Plant
  (McAAP). During these operations, conventional explosives destroy obsolete
  munitions stored in pits through a controlled sequence of electronically timed
  shots that occur over tens of minutes. Despite noise‐abatement efforts that
  reduce coupling of acoustic energy with air, some lower frequency, subaudible
  (infrasonic) sound radiates from these shots as discrete pulses. We use nine
  months of blast log documents, seismic network records, analyst picks, and
  physical modeling to demonstrate that seismic stations as far as 640 km from
  McAAP sample these pulses, which record seasonal patterns in stratospheric and
  tropospheric winds, as well as the dynamic formation of waveguides and shadow
  zones. Digital short‐term average to long‐term average detectors that we
  augment with dynamic thresholds and time‐binning operations identify these
  pulses with a fair probability, when compared with visual observations. Our
  analyses thereby provide estimates of observation rates for both partial and
  full sequences of these pulses, as well as single shots. We suggest that
  disposal operations can exploit existing, composite seismic networks to
  predict where residents are likely to witness blasting. Crucially, our data
  also show that dense seismic networks can record multiscale atmospheric
  processes in the absence of infrasound arrays.
