abstract: While studies of urban acoustics are typically restricted to the audio
  range, anthropogenic activity also generates infrasound (<20 Hz, roughly at
  the lower end of the range of human hearing). Shutdowns related to the
  COVID-19 pandemic unintentionally created ideal conditions for the study of
  urban infrasound and low frequency audio (20–500 Hz), as closures reduced
  human-generated ambient noise, while natural signals remained relatively
  unaffected. An array of infrasound sensors deployed in Las Vegas, NV, provides
  data for a case study in monitoring human activity during the pandemic through
  urban acoustics. The array records a sharp decline in acoustic power following
  the temporary shutdown of businesses deemed nonessential by the state of
  Nevada. This decline varies spatially across the array, with stations close to
  McCarran International Airport generally recording the greatest declines in
  acoustic power. Further, declines in acoustic power fluctuate with the time of
  day. As only signals associated with anthropogenic activity are expected to
  decline, this gives a rough indication of periodicities in urban acoustics
  throughout Las Vegas. The results of this study reflect the city's response to
  the pandemic and suggest spatiotemporal trends in acoustics outside of
  shutdowns.
