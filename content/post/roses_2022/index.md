In 2022, we partnered with the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology to offer a ROSES-Lite program.  This program provided students with the opportunity to work through 2020 and 2021 ROSES content on their own across a two-week period.  At the end of each period, a Zoom-based TA session allowed students to troubleshoot and ask questions.
