In 2020, as a student representative of the [American Geophysical Union Seismology Section](https://connect.agu.org/seismology/roses/aboutroses), I conceptualized, organized and offered the ROSES Seismology Summer School for the first time. Targeted at graduate students, ROSES was a series of 11 virtual sessions offered over Zoom. Coupled with interactive Python notebooks and delivered by field experts, the course sessions presented an opportunity to gain experience with aspects of seismology spanning a range of applications and data-types, as well as an opportunity to interact and network with seismologists across the globe.  
Materials from ROSES2020 are available via [Youtube](https://connect.agu.org/seismology/roses/roses2020materials) and [GitHub](https://github.com/roseseismo/roses2020).  Further information about the course content, structure and lessons learned can be found in [Dannemann Dugick et al., (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1785/0220200421).
