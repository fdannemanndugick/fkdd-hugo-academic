## Overview

Our research team at [Sandia National Laboratories](https://www.sandia.gov/) is always looking for students and postdocs interested in geophysics, seismoacoustics and explosion monitoring.  We offer both year-round and summer internship options, with opportunities for remote work.  Interns are hired through the Monitoring Systems and Technology Internship Center.  Look for open postings [here](https://www.sandia.gov/careers/career-possibilities/students-and-postdocs/internships-co-ops/institute-programs/monitoring-systems-and-technology-intern-center/) or feel free to reach out to me directly via email.
