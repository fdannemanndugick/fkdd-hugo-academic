In 2020, the [American Geophysical Union Seismology Section](https://connect.agu.org/seismology/roses/aboutroses) offered the ROSES Seismology Summer School for the first time. Targeted at graduate students, ROSES was a series of 11 virtual sessions offered over Zoom. Coupled with interactive Python notebooks and delivered by field experts, the course sessions presented an opportunity to gain experience with aspects of seismology spanning a range of applications and data-types, as well as an opportunity to interact and network with seismologists across the globe.

ROSES returned for 2021, targeting MS students, PhD students, early career researchers and lecturers, and incoming graduate students that had already taken the [IRIS Seismology Skill Building Workshop](https://www.iris.edu/hq/workshops/2021/01/ssb_2) or had the applicable computing experience. 

The over-arching goals of the ROSES program are to cultivate a successful, cohort-based learning environment while expanding accessibility globally â€“ offering synchronous and asynchronous options for lectures, facilitating regional working groups, and providing a global forum for collaborative discussion.
